# UI
----

color drop instead of word
shape tweening instead of word
direction arrow for compass directions


# Levels
----
These probably need lots of repetition of the concept, but levels of complexity could be:

## level 1
circle firing left to right through gate and off screen. Goal directly under gate.
change gate to turn circles S (or 90°)
when hit{
    turn pulse South
}

## level 2
Two gates. As above, but with barrier between gate and goal.
Turn the circle towards the other gate, then into the goal.

## level 3
As level 1, but with two goals. One red, beneath the gate, one blue above.
when hit {
    if pulse is red {
        turn N
    }
    if pulse is blue {
        turn S
    }
}

## level 4
As level 3, but using shape instead of color.

## level 5
Color and shape

## level 6
Variables: boolean flag
when hit {
    if flag is true {
        turn N
    }
    if flag is false {
        turn S
    }
    toggle flag;
}

## level 7
Variables: incrementing a value
when hit {
    if counter < 5 {
        turn N
    }
    if counter >= 5 {
        turn S
    }
    add 1 to counter
}

## level 8, combining ideas
when hit {
    if counter < 5 and blue and square {
        turn N
    }
    if red and circle {
        add 1 to counter
    }
}

# Features to do: levels
- rules need to visually show their criteria: color / color and shape
– remove element from list when it's accepted into a goal
- add blockers, blocker list and collision tests
– create some levels
- define level loading: nodes, pulses, goals, color and shapes lists for level
– create level menu

# Features: synth and free play
- normalise sound speed: diagonal speed greater than straight.
- new rule click
- click to edit goals logic
– click to edit emitters

# General features
- remove pulse from list when it leaves the screen
- level editor
– Visual styling and animation for emitters
– new UI for changing color, shape and direction
- split out edit panel logic into components
- rules for changing dx/y as well as setting (+1, -1 etc)
– UI alternatives to cycling though options (drop downs, task specific pickers, etc)

# Rule components
– drum pad events animation
– tooltip on hover / click of element to expand to text
    – hover over color drop: "color is red"
    – hover over shape: "shape is triangle"
    – 'set direction to North'
    – 'play sound snare'
– UI to change sample packs in one click (sample packs of 9 sounds)
– try color drop animations: mask complex svg pattern with drop shape, and animate it up on click (build transition into svg behind)
